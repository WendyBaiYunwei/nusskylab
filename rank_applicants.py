#a helper script that helps the admin rank applicant teams
#input: google form csv, students.csv
#output: a new csv file called "applicant rank.csv", with
#applicant teams ranked according to average ranking from google form responses
#the logic of this script is not straightforward. advice is to rewrite if you want to modify something
